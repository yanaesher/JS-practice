 * Credit to https://adventofcode.com/ for this exercise
 * 
 * Each object in the passwordList gives a password policy and then the password.
 * The times field says the minimal and maximal amount of times the letter should be in the password. So 1-3 means at least 1 time, at most 3 times.
 * The letter field gives which letter should be counted
 * The password field gives the password
 * 
 * In the list 2 passwords are valid, the middle one is not as there is no b in the password.
 * 
 * We expect the output:
 * 
 * 'abcde' is VALID, a is present 1 times and should have been present at least 1 and at most 3 times
 * 'cdefg' is INVALID, b is present 0 times and should have been present at least 1 and at most 3 times
 * 'ccccccccc' is VALID, c is present 9 times and should have been present at least 2 and at most 9 times
